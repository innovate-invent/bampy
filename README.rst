Python implementation of htslib supporting BAM, SAM, and BGZF compression

Notes
-----
- This is a raw initial release and is largely untested.
- Missing some features such as seamlessly handling long CIGAR strings
- Code documentation in progress
- Basically I just wanted to put this out there and most should sit tight until version 1.0.0
